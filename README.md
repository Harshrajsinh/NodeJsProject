#Node.js Workshop

##Purpose
The purpose of this workshop is to teach those who are new to Node.js how to get up and running with their
very own Node.js application.  You will learn now to initialize a Node project, how to utilize npm(Node package manager) 
to add dependencies to your project, and how to build your very first API.  By the end of this workshop you will have an 
API that you can access from a web browser to provide a friendly greeting.  You will also hopefully have a better 
understanding of APIs and how they work on a more general level.
 
 
This project has numbered branches that you can checkout if you get lost along the way, the number will correspond to the
 step that it is next to in this README, so if have problems with step 15, you could do:  ``git checkout 15`` 
 
##Install Node.js and NPM
To initialize the project you first need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your system, you can get node here: 
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Initialize the project (Branch 1)
Once that is done you first need to initialize the project.  When you initialize the project, it will create a file named: 
``package.json``.  This file allows you to define your project and provide it with a name, description, a version number, etc.
It also allows you to add and track dependencies for your project.
